# Ava - Personal Voice Assistant

Ava is a personal voice assistant built using Python. It can recognize voice commands and perform various tasks like opening applications, searching Google, fetching weather information, setting alarms, timers, reminders, and more. Ava also includes additional features like telling jokes and playing Telugu songs on YouTube.

## Features
- Open applications (e.g., Chrome, Notepad, Calculator, etc.)
- Search Google
- Fetch weather information
- Set alarms and timers
- Set reminders
- Tell jokes
- Play Telugu songs on YouTube
- More commands can be added!

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x
2. Required Python libraries:
   - `pyttsx3` (for text-to-speech)
   - `SpeechRecognition` (for voice recognition)
   - `requests` (for HTTP requests to fetch data)
   - `webbrowser` (to open web pages)
   - `subprocess` (to open applications)
   - `datetime` (to handle alarms and timers)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition requests
```

## How to Set Up

1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/ava-assistant.git
```

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project is located.

3. Install the required Python libraries as mentioned above.

4. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `get_weather()` function with your OpenWeather API key. You can get it by signing up at [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

## How to Run Ava

1. Open a terminal and run the Python script:

```bash
python ava.py
```

2. Ava will begin listening for voice commands. Here are some commands you can try:

   - **Open Applications:**
     - "Open YouTube"
     - "Open Chrome"
     - "Open WhatsApp"
   
   - **Search Google:**
     - "Search Google for Python programming tutorials"
   
   - **Get Weather:**
     - "What's the weather?"
     - "What's the weather in [city name]?"
   
   - **Set Alarms and Timers:**
     - "Set an alarm for 7:00 AM"
     - "Set a timer for 10 minutes"
   
   - **Set Reminders:**
     - "Remind me to call John at 3 PM"
   
   - **Entertainment:**
     - "Tell me a joke"
     - "Play Telugu songs"

## How to Add More Features

- You can easily extend Ava’s functionality by adding more commands to the `handle_command()` function. Simply define a new function for the task you want to perform and call it based on the user's voice command.

Example of adding a new feature:
```python
def play_music():
    webbrowser.open("https://open.spotify.com/")
    speak("Playing music on Spotify.")
```

In `handle_command()`:
```python
elif "play music" in command:
    play_music()
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Speech Recognition Issue: If Ava doesn’t recognize your voice, try adjusting the sensitivity of the microphone or ensuring that no background noise is present.
2. Weather API Issues: If you get a `RequestError` for weather, make sure your internet connection is active, and the API key is correct.
